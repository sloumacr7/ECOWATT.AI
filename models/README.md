# EcoWatt Model Folder

This folder contains all scripts and files related to the machine learning model used in the EcoWatt project.

## File Descriptions

- **`model.py`**: Defines the architecture of the neural network model.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Contains functions for data preprocessing like scaling and splitting.
- **`feature_extraction.py`**: Extracts relevant features from raw energy consumption data.
- **`train_model.py`**: Trains the model using the processed data and extracted features.
- **`evaluate_model.py`**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
- **`save_model.py`**: Contains functions for saving and loading trained models.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for running the model scripts.

## Instructions

1. Preprocess the raw data with `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Extract features using `feature_extraction.py`.
3. Train the model with `train_model.py`.
4. Evaluate the model performance with `evaluate_model.py`.
5. Save or load the model using `save_model.py`.
