# EcoWatt Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used in the EcoWatt project for energy consumption prediction, anomaly detection, and model evaluation.

## Notebooks

- **`01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`**: Data loading, preprocessing, and exploration.
- **`02_feature_extraction.ipynb`**: Extracting meaningful features from raw data.
- **`03_train_model.ipynb`**: Training the model with preprocessed data.
- **`04_evaluate_model.ipynb`**: Evaluating the model's performance and visualizing results.
- **`05_anomaly_detection.ipynb`**: Detecting anomalies in energy consumption patterns.

## Instructions

1. Open the notebooks in order to explore and train the model.
2. Make sure to have the required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt`).
3. Modify the paths to the dataset in each notebook as needed.
