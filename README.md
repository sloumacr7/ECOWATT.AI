<h1 align="center">EcoWatt: AI-driven Energy Management Solution</h1>

<p align="center"><em>Optimizing Energy Consumption for a Sustainable Future</em></p>

## Overview

EcoWatt is an advanced energy management solution designed to optimize energy consumption in industrial buildings. The system leverages Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze and manage energy usage, reducing energy waste, improving efficiency, and supporting sustainability. By monitoring electrical loads and applying predictive analytics, EcoWatt helps industries identify inefficiencies and potential savings.

## Features

- **Energy Consumption Prediction**: Predict energy usage based on historical data and operational factors.
- **Load Disaggregation (NILM)**: Break down total energy consumption into individual machines or equipment to track specific usage.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal patterns in energy consumption that could indicate equipment malfunction or inefficiency.
- **Energy Efficiency Scoring**: Score the energy efficiency of different equipment and overall building performance.
- **Predictive Alerts**: Provide real-time alerts for maintenance needs or abnormal consumption patterns.
- **Sustainability Reporting**: Generate reports to track and optimize energy consumption for sustainability goals.
