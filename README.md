EcoWatt: AI-driven Energy Management Solution
Overview
EcoWatt is an advanced energy management solution designed to optimize energy consumption in industrial buildings. The system leverages Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze and manage energy usage, reducing energy waste, improving efficiency, and supporting sustainability. By monitoring electrical loads and applying predictive analytics, EcoWatt helps industries identify inefficiencies and potential savings.
